# Computational text analysis for Spring 2019

Workshop for UC Berkeley's D-Lab Computational text analysis. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

# Workshop Goals 

* what computational text analysis can do, and what it can't do
* preprocessing text data
* implementing simple unsupervised methods (tf-idf, topic model, cosine similarity) and supervised methods (classification with logistic regression) using a bag-of-word approach
* interpreting results
* if time permits, introduction to word vector representations
* where to go next to learn and seek help with your computational text analysis projects


This will be in Python. If you would like to follow along with the implementation details, you will need some familiarity with Python. Completion of D-Lab's Python FUN!damentals workshop series is sufficient.

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab
D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. View our [calendar](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) for upcoming events, and also learn about how to utilize our [consulting](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources) services. 

IOKN2K! is an acronym and it stands for It’s OK Not To Know!  And like every other meme, it means more than its acronym. IOKN2K! means is that D-Lab is a place to feel comfortable asking questions; D-Lab is a place to learn the skills that you don’t have yet. Bring your wonder to D-Lab. IOKN2K!
